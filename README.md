# Privacy Knowledge Q&A Platform

A revolutionary anonymous question-and-answer platform built with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, ensuring complete privacy protection for user interactions and data.

## Core Concepts

### FHE-Powered Anonymous Q&A Platform
This platform leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to create a truly private knowledge-sharing environment where users can ask and answer questions without revealing their identities or sensitive information. The system maintains complete anonymity while ensuring data integrity and authenticity.

### Privacy Knowledge Exchange
The platform specializes in privacy-focused knowledge sharing across multiple categories including Technology, Science, Business, Health, Education, Privacy, and Security. Users can participate in discussions while maintaining complete confidentiality through advanced cryptographic techniques.

## Key Features

- **Anonymous Question Posting**: Submit questions with encrypted content that remains private
- **Reputation-Based System**: Encrypted reputation scores that protect user privacy
- **Bounty Mechanism**: Incentivize quality answers with cryptocurrency rewards
- **Expert Verification**: Verified experts can validate answers while maintaining anonymity
- **Category Organization**: Questions organized across multiple knowledge domains
- **Profile Privacy**: User profiles with encrypted reputation and contribution data

## Smart Contract

The platform is powered by a sophisticated smart contract that handles:
- Question and answer storage with encryption
- User reputation management with FHE operations
- Bounty distribution and reward mechanisms
- Expert verification and answer validation
- Category-based question organization

**Contract Address**: `0xF09C6faDa8879c2f047e21318e41740429cA5D45`
